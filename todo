implement graceful stop with ctrl c, first time stop sending new jobs, second time quit completely
fix logging with multiprocessing -> allegedly needs locking
make wait time a parameter
check process running
check memcached via port
print progress, enable with switch
--nocolor?
--trace?
fix information display, on fail show arguments, etc
fix if no host file and no pattern is given

done:
check_sessions = always_true for session-less services)
implement icmp check
add empty check that will return always with true (and again for fals for testing?), so same command can be used for clsuters which doesn't have some functionality (
when waiting, use a timeout, and on reaching the timeout (or failed check result) iterate between the checks, to give a chance to all of them to return a true value
implement switch for running on all clusters
missing checks should be always OK (or error, configurable)
if skipped host, don't say all was fine
