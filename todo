implement graceful stop with ctrl c, first time stop sending new jobs, second time quit completely
fix logging with multiprocessing -> allegedly needs locking
implement icmp check
make wait time a parameter
when waiting with 'any', iterate between the checks, to give a chance to all of them to return a true value
add empty check that will return always with true (and again for fals for testing?), so same command can be used for clsuters which doesn't have some functionality (check_sessions = always_true for session-less services)
