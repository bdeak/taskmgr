implement graceful stop with ctrl c, first time stop sending new jobs, second time quit completely
fix logging with multiprocessing -> allegedly needs locking
make wait time a parameter
when waiting with 'any', iterate between the checks, to give a chance to all of them to return a true value
add empty check that will return always with true (and again for fals for testing?), so same command can be used for clsuters which doesn't have some functionality (

done:
check_sessions = always_true for session-less services)
implement icmp check
